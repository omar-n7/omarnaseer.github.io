# omarnaseer.github.io

This is my personal website that I created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It is not completely mobile-friendly as of yet as I was using 
this particular project to try out some new skills and wasn't necessarily preparing it for professional use at the time. 

That's also why you may notice that there isn't much documentation either.
